The MATLAB codes for reproducing the figures in our paper:

Fast matrix exponential-based quasi-boundary value methods for inverse
space-dependent source problems, by FermÄ±n Bazan, Luciano Bedin, Koung Hee Leeem, Jun Liu *, George
Pelekanos.

- (MatExpQBVM_ISP_1D.m), for 1D Example1 1-3
- (MatExpQBVM_ISP_2D.m), for 2D Example 4

Notice the 2D Example 4 used matrix exponential times vector function **expmv**
